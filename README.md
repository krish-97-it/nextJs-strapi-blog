## üåç Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
   In Client-Side Rendering, the page is rendered in the browser using JavaScript. The initial page load is minimal, and then Next.js fetches data after the page loads.

   ‚úÖ When to Use CSR ?
      + When SEO is not a priority (e.g., dashboards, user profiles).
      + When data is highly dynamic and frequently changes (e.g., real-time apps).
      + When you want to reduce server load.

   üõ† How to Implement CSR
   + Use the useEffect hook to fetch data after the component mounts. <br>
      ```
         import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
         export default function ContactUs() {
           const [data, setData] = useState(null);
           useEffect(() => {
             fetch("https://your-wordpress-site.com/graphql", {
               method: "POST",
               headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
               body: JSON.stringify({
                 query: `{ pageBy(uri: "contact-us") { title content } }`,
               }),
             })
               .then((res) => res.json())
               .then((result) => setData(result.data.pageBy));
           }, []);
           if (!data) return <p>Loading...</p>;
           return (
             <div>
               <h1>{data.title}</h1>
               <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: data.content }} />
             </div>
           );
         }
      ```

   üìå Key Notes:
   + Data is fetched after the page is loaded.
   + No SEO benefits since search engines see an empty page at first.
   + Great for interactive apps where content frequently updates.

   ‚ö° Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
     In Server-Side Rendering, Next.js pre-renders the page on the server for every request. This ensures that the client receives a fully rendered HTML page with data.

   ‚úÖ When to Use SSR ?
   + When SEO is important (e.g., landing pages, blogs, e-commerce).
   + When the content needs to be fresh on every request.
   + When you want to avoid exposing API keys in the frontend.

   üõ† How to Implement SSR
   + Use getServerSideProps to fetch data at request time.<br>

      ```
         export async function getServerSideProps() {
           const res = await fetch("https://your-wordpress-site.com/graphql", {
             method: "POST",
             headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
             body: JSON.stringify({
               query: `{ pageBy(uri: "contact-us") { title content } }`,
             }),
           });
           const { data } = await res.json();
           return {
             props: {
               page: data.pageBy,
             },
           };
         }
         export default function ContactUs({ page }) {
           return (
             <div>
               <h1>{page.title}</h1>
               <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: page.content }} />
             </div>
           );
         }
      ```
üìå Key Notes:
+ Better for SEO because the page is fully rendered on the server.
+ Slower than CSR since it renders on every request.
+ Good for frequently updated content (e.g., news, logged-in user content).
